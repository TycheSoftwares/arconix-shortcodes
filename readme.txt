= 0.9.5 =
* Maybe one of these days I'll get this right. Thanks to @gasie for setting me straight. This plugin is now loading jquery-tools without the a bundled jQuery. As such, I've added a jQuery dependency to my script registration which will load the WordPress supplied version. All of that simply means jQuery conflicts with other properly-coded plugins should be a thing of the past.

= 0.9.4 =
* accidently supplied the wrong version of jquery-tools script

= 0.9.3 =
* update the jquery-tools script to the latest v1.2.6

= 0.9.2 =
* Only load the javascript if a shortcode requires it to function
* Fix a typo in the four_fiths column function

= 0.9.1 =
* Added a load attribute to the accordions shortcode. This attribute allows the user to define which accordion is open by default when the page loads. The default is 1 and will load with the 1st accordion visible, but supports 0 (all accordions load closed) through 5 (the 5th accordion is open on load).

= 0.9 =
